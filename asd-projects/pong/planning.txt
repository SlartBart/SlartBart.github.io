gameplay: 
    Bounce a ball off of two platforms, controlled by two players. 
    On startup, platforms in center on their sides, ball in true center of screen, ball movement randomized, but never more than facing 95% upward, or 95% to the side
    Game ends after 20 rounds
    ifs:
        if hit wall, bounce
        if hit score area, reset ball position and paddle position, wait until spacebar pressed to start next round
        if hit paddle, alter both speed and vector movement, not just reverse, make it change how fast it moves up/dowm and left/right
        if totalRounds is 20, initiate endgame sequence: remove all objects on screen, compare player1 to player2, and output appropriate responce. 
        nonessentials:
            after each bounce, make ball move faster and paddles, 
            after 10 bounces between paddles, increase point value of the match. 

components:
    static:
        changed: keep origional screen for now, change later. 
        score total: on screen, top middle, with player1:player2 style
        messages, in the middle of the screen, displayed at appropriate moments: 
            "press space to start game"
            "press space for next match"
            "player x wins, with y points"
            "its a tie!"
        match value, underneath the score total
    moving:
        paddles for player one and player two:
            need position value, 
            only alter the y value, 
        ball:
            positionx and positiony values
            speed value
            current movement method
    displayed data:
        score of player1
        score of player2
        match value data

events:
    user-event: 
        arrow keys up/down determine player1 position
        w and s in the WASD block determine player 2 position
        spacebar to continue a game after a match is over, and to reset the board after game over and score desplay
    gameplay-event:
        wall-bounce:
            invert y movement as needed, if bottom, movement now up, if top, movement now down
        paddle bounce:
            invert x movement and increase intensity after every 3 hits
            change y movement factor, or invert it entirely, randomly
        score:
            increase corresponding player's score by match value, and move into next match sequence
